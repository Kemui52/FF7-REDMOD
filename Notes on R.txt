-What did I need to do?

Extra dungeons:
 Last map
 Great Glacier
  Snow boss
  Gaia's cliff
Restarted Disc 1 efforts
Everyone's Limits should work fine enough.
 Apparently, l missed some stats. NOW should be fine.
 Add descriptions where missing.
  All done?
Mini status always inflicts and lowers attack
 As such, Cornucopia is only cure and raises attack
Round Square needs to be revisited. Prolly have to break the fourth wall.
Chocobo Square door can be opened, huh? Ought to work that in considering what I did to Battle


-Replaced files:
Kernel.bin
LimtMenu.mnu
Scene.bin
md8brdg2.bsx	(Proud)
del3.bsx	(Tifa)
del12.bsx	(Tifa)

-Field folder:
(32 is the difference in movement orientation for L1/R1)
 -Shifted Files (now they're just files l know l made really short):
 semkin_3
 semkin_4
 semkin_8
 coloin1
 4sbwy_22
 canon_2
 md8brdg2
 del12
 del3
 blin63_t
 colne_1 (increased filesize)

-Unexplained BS
 md8_4 will randomly hang before Main???
  found out it simply hates the model swop, so skipping this map

-DAT model data:
Red	04 1E 16 __ 00 00 00 05
Aeris	01 18 10 __ 00 00 00 02
--BSX data
 Header's 0x4 points to model info. From there...
 0x0 RAM-style pointer to itself?
 0x4 Number of models
 0x8 Unknown, maybe pointer to end of data?
 0xC Memory allocation amount. Increasing this by 0x1000 fixes lighting.

-Potential outline for building BIG disc
Start with fresh FF7 disc	//why not use R disc?
Use MassIsoUpdate to inject FIELD folder
Use ff7tools fixup script on new file
Use CDmage to inject Kernel and others so their allocations aren't too small
Done?
