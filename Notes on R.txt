-What did I need to do?

Extra dungeons:
 Last map
 Great Glacier
  Snow boss
  Gaia's cliff
Restarted Disc 1 efforts
Everyone's Limits should work fine enough.
 Apparently, l missed some stats. NOW should be fine.
 Add descriptions where missing.
  All done?
Mini status always inflicts and lowers attack
 As such, Cornucopia is only cure and raises attack
Round Square needs to be revisited. Prolly have to break the fourth wall.
Chocobo Square door can be opened, huh? Ought to work that in considering what I did to Battle
